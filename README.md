# CARMA Deployment Project

Welcome to the GitHub Pages deployment repository for one of the applications within the [Carma Monorepo](https://github.com/cismet/carma). This repository serves as the deployment endpoint for an application built under the cids architecture for reactive mapping applications (CARMA) framework, managed by cismet GmbH.

## About the Project

This repository contains the deployed code for a specific application from the extensive Carma Monorepo, which includes a wide array of applications. The code in the `main` branch here is solely for deployment purposes; it does not contain the source code itself.

### Important Links

## Deployment Details

The deployment to this repository's `gh-pages` branch is automated. Each push to the `dev` branch of the Carma Monorepo triggers a build process, followed by a deployment to this repository. It is important to note that while this deployment is fully functional, it is not the production environment URL.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and should be directed to the Carma Monorepo. If you are interested in contributing to the development and enhancement of the applications within the CARMA framework, please visit the main repository:
